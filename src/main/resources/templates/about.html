  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I’m <strong>Naga Sai Kondru</strong>, a passionate <strong>Full Stack Software Engineer</strong> who loves building modern,
    scalable web applications and solving real-world challenges through code. I’ve spent the past few years developing
    <strong>microservices-based solutions</strong> and integrating them with cloud platforms like <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Azure</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in <strong>Java, Spring Boot, and React.js</strong> — creating robust APIs and intuitive front-end experiences that
    deliver speed, security, and reliability. My day-to-day involves designing <strong>RESTful services</strong>, implementing
    <strong>Spring Security with OAuth2</strong>, and automating workflows with <strong>Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Docker</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What drives me most is turning ideas into practical, high-performing applications. I’ve worked closely with product teams
    to translate business needs into clean, maintainable code, while also focusing on performance improvements and system stability.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have extensive experience working with both relational and NoSQL databases — including <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>,
    <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong>. From optimizing SQL queries and writing stored procedures to
    designing scalable NoSQL data models, I enjoy structuring data systems that improve performance, consistency, and
    scalability across distributed environments.
